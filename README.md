## Description
This project is a part of the Becode.org AI Bootcamp programme. The goal is to produce a supervised classifier for anomalous sound detection in industrial machines for a fictional company Acme Corporation. Data samples of normal and abnormal sounds of valves, pumps, fans and sliders are provided.

## Objectives

- Be able to parse json files
- Be able to build and deploy an app using Flask, Docker, and Heroku
- Be able to save json data into an SQL database
- Be able to design a relational SQL database
- Be able to visualize data from a SQL database
- Be able to deploy said database alongside (interactive) visualizations

### Strengths

- Normalised SQL database
- Full pipeline:  JSON to SQL, data insights, Flask + HTML, Docker, Heroku.

### Limitations

- Not all data normalised. 
- 

### Further Developments

- Creating more columns in the database.
- Performing more insights.
- Creating interactive dashboard.
