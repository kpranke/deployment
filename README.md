## Objectives

- Be able to parse JSON files
- Be able to build and deploy an app using Flask, Docker, and Heroku
- Be able to save json data into an SQL database
- Be able to design a relational SQL database
- Be able to visualize data from a SQL database
- Be able to deploy said database alongside (interactive) visualizations

### Strengths

- Normalised SQL database (See: the ER diagram below)
- Full pipeline:  JSON to SQL, data insights, Flask + HTML, Docker, Heroku.

### Limitations

- Not all data was transformed to a normalised database.

### Further Developments

- Creating more columns in the database.
- Performing more insights.
- Creating interactive dashboard.
